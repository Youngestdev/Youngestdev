### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Abdulazeez âš¡ and, I love working with programs. I also love to write articles on React, JavaScript and Python.

## What am I working on ?

 ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building simple tools and backend REST APIs. When I'm not building simple tools, I'm on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/_abdu) solving problems or writing about data structures [on my blog.](https://blog.youngest.dev)

## What am I learning ?

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to build efficient backend servers (or APIs) with the FastAPI framework. I am also learning how to write efficient algorithms for different problems ranging from strings to graphs etc.

I am also learning Clojure. I want to feed my functional language curiosity.

## Want to collaborate on something ?

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on building APIs, technical documentations [PAID COLLABORATIONS], and even pair coding sessions not limited to problem solving.

## Want to help me ? 

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with explaining hard algorithms - Graphs, contract jobs on technical writing, software dev contracts are a plus too.

You can also hire me to be your mentor. I was a volunteer mentor in GSoC in 2018.

## Have a question?

I'm particularly open to questions free of toxicity and my personal life. However, you can always ask me anything by reaching me by any of the means in the next section.
